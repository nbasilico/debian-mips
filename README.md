# Playing with MIPS assembly on Debian

*The following tutorial is an advanced annex to the laboratory course of Computer Architecture II, given in the Computer Science B.Sc. program at the University of Milan. The work is the result of a joint idea and work with Jacopo Essenziale who helped me in bringing this tutorial from a nerdy "coffee-break" discussion to an actual playground for students to enjoy. We are constantly searching for new ideas and suggestions. If you have any comments or would like to contribute feel free to contact us.*

## Scope of this tutorial

A great number of Computer Architecture courses adopts the MIPS architecture as a subject of study due to its simplicity. Many of such courses have lab sessions that involve Assembly programming. So do we at the University of Milan. 

Just like many of these lab courses around the world, we run our Assembly programs in a simulated environment using great tools like Spim or Mars.  From one side, this approach tremendously simplifies the task of teaching Assembly to first-year students. From the other side, a simulator **is not the real thing**.
