# Playing with MIPS assembly on Debian



---

*The following tutorial is an advanced annex to the laboratory course of Computer Architecture II, given in the Computer Science B.Sc. program at the University of Milan.*

*The work is the result of a joint idea and work with Jacopo Essenziale who helped me in bringing this tutorial from a nerdy "coffee-break" discussion to an actual playground for students to enjoy.*

*We are constantly searching for new ideas and suggestions. If you have any comments or ideas please feel free to contact us.*
